Chapter 3, titled "Design and Planning," of "Event-Driven Architecture in Golang" focuses on the crucial initial steps of building an application with an event-driven approach, emphasizing the importance of a deep understanding of the problem space before writing code.

The main ideas and key knowledge from Chapter 3 include:

- **Understanding What to Build**: The chapter highlights that before immediately writing code, it's essential to have a clear plan built on a better understanding of the problem the application intends to solve. For the MallBots application, this involves moving from an initial pitch and high-level view to a detailed design. The proposed process to achieve this includes using EventStorming, capturing capabilities as executable specifications, and recording architectural decisions.

- **Finding Answers with EventStorming**:

  - **What it is**: EventStorming is presented as a fun, engaging **workshop technique** that uses colorful sticky notes to visualize the building blocks of application flows. Its goal is to uncover implicit details and share knowledge among domain experts and developers. It encourages multiple conversations simultaneously, unlike traditional meetings.
  - **Core Concepts**: Key EventStorming concepts, often represented by different colored sticky notes, include:
    - **Domain event (orange)**: Something that has an impact on the system, written in the past tense (e.g., "PaymentReceived").
    - **Command (blue)**: An action or decision invoked by users or policies (e.g., "AddItem").
    - **Policy (lilac)**: A business rule identified by "whenever <x>, then <y>".
    - **Aggregate (tan)**: A group of domain entities acted on as a single unit (e.g., "Order").
    - **External system (pink)**: A third-party system or internal service not controlled by the workshop participants.
    - **Data (green)**: Information recorded in the system or required for commands/rules.
    - **Actor (yellow)**: A user, role, or persona creating actions.
    - **UI (white)**: An interface example or screen mockup.
  - **Big Picture EventStorming**: This format focuses on the discovery of **bounded contexts** and **ubiquitous languages** by examining the entire business problem. The process involves several steps:
    1.  **Kick-off**: Introduces goals and participants.
    2.  **Chaotic exploration**: Participants independently identify and place domain events on a timeline.
    3.  **Enforcing the timeline**: Events are organized chronologically and grouped into flows, potentially using pivotal events or swim lanes.
    4.  **People and systems**: Identifying who or what triggers events and any external systems involved, often revealing new flows or events.
    5.  **Explicit walk-through**: Participants narrate the events as a story to check for missing or misplaced events. This step helps make implicit details explicit.
    6.  **Problems and opportunities**: Participants identify remaining issues and suggest improvements for future versions.
  - **Design-level EventStorming**: This format delves deeper into a _single core bounded context_, adding more concepts to refine the process design.

- **Understanding the Business with Executable Specifications**:

  - This section introduces **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** and **executable specifications** as a bridge between design and planning. BDD aims to keep the distance between business needs and developed solutions as small as possible.
  - **Gherkin** is used to write features and scenarios, describing _what_ the application should do, not _how_. These are machine-readable and can be used for **acceptance testing** in a CI/CD pipeline.

- **Recording Architectural Decisions (ADRs)**:
  - ADRs are introduced as a method to **document significant architectural decisions** and their motivations, preventing loss of context over time.
  - They typically follow a structured format including: **Context**, **Decision**, **Status** (Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, Superseded, Deprecated), and **Consequences**.
  - ADRs are stored in the code repository and treated as an immutable log, with new documents written for new decisions.

In essence, Chapter 3 is like drawing a detailed blueprint for a complex building before laying the foundation. It provides the tools and methodologies, primarily EventStorming and BDD, to thoroughly understand the requirements, collaboratively define the structure, and explicitly document key design choices (ADRs) to ensure everyone involved is aligned and the project starts on a solid, shared understanding.
